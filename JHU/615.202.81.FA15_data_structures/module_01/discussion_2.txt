Telescope - as I work for a space agency, it seemed like a logical choice!

The basic functionality of a telescope is to provide the ability to point to and capture photons of distant objects.

How one would implimentationt this is a permutation of a few significant aspects, each with trade-offs:

space-based, ground-based, on an airplane, in a baloon, in a rocket
size range (1-30 meters)
sensitive to radio, IR, visible, UV, x-ray, gamma-ray
camera for images, spectrograph for spectra, rapid counter for transients

ADT Longboard
  Data
    position           (x, y) location on the surface of the earth
    velocity           (speed, direction) of movement
  Methods
    Move 
      Input            Speed
      Precondition     None
      Process          Set velocity speed to Input
      Postcondition    None
      Output           None
    Turn
       Input           Direction to turn
       Precondition    Velocity > 0
       Process         Set velocity direction to Input
       Postcondition   None
       Output          None
    Stop
       Input           None    
       Precondition    None
       Process         Set velocity to 0
       Postcondition   None
       Output          None
  End ADT Longboard
