The little endian and big endian representations are reverses of each other as shown below. \\

  0 & 16 & 16 & 16 & 0 & 32 \\ \hline
\end{tabular} \\

0 for the op code makes this an R-type instruction which corresponds to the assembly code:
\begin{verbatim}
add $s0, $s0, $s0
\end{verbatim}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{2.15)} 

\begin{verbatim}
sw $t1, 32($t2)
\end{verbatim}

\noindent The \$t1 register's number code is $9_{10}$, and the \$t2 register's number is $10_{10}$.  The sw (store word) op code is $43_{10}$, which makes this and I-type instruction.
\\


\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c |}
  \hline	
  op code & source register & destination & constant or address\\  \hline  		
  101011 & 01001 & 01010 & 0000000000100000 \\ \hline
  43 & 9 & 10 & 32  \\ \hline
\end{tabular} \\

\noindent Converting this binary representation to hexadecimal gives the value: AD2A0020

\section*{2.16)} 

\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c | c | c |}
  \hline	
  op code & source register & second source & dest. register & shift amount & function \\  \hline  		
  000000 & 00011 & 00010 & 00011 & 00000 & 100010  \\ \hline
  0 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 0 & 34 \\ \hline
  R-type & \$v1 & \$v0 & \$v1 & 0 & sub \\\hline
\end{tabular} \\

The op code of 0 identifies this as an R-type instruction, and the function value of $34_{10}$ identifies this as subtraction.  The assembly instruction is then:

\begin{verbatim}
sub $v1, $v0, $v1
\end{verbatim}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{3.17)} 
 Op code $23_{hex} = 35_{10} =$ lw.  Register 1 is \$at, and register 2 is \$v0.  Op code of lw identifies this as an I-type instruction, so the cons is the address for the last 16 bits of the instruction.  The binary representation and assembly instruction is then: \\
 
 \noindent
 \begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c |}
  \hline	
  op code & source register & destination & constant or address\\  \hline  		
  1000011 & 00010 & 00001 & 0000000000000100 \\ \hline
  43 & 9 & 10 & 32  \\ \hline
  lw & \$at & \$v0 & 4 \\ \hline
\end{tabular} \\

 
\begin{verbatim}
lw $v0, 4($at)
