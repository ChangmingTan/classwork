Data input to tree:
1 2 3 4 5 6 
#-- Finding the tree height from: 1
following path through 2, 
following path through 3, 
following path through 4, 
following path through 5, 
following path through 6, 
path terminated at: 6
This tree's height is: 5
#-- Finding the leaf nodes from: 1
Found path to 2
Found path to 3
Found path to 4
Found path to 5
Found path to 6
Found 6 to be a leaf.
The number of leaves is: 1
#-- Finding the nonleaf nodes from: 1
1 is found to not be a leaf.
2 is found to not be a leaf.
3 is found to not be a leaf.
4 is found to not be a leaf.
5 is found to not be a leaf.
6 is a leaf.
The number of non-leaves is: 5
And the post-order traversal is: 
6 5 4 3 2 1
