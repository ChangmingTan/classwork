I have commented nearly everything that calls something non-similar to C++, and have not used any "short-cuts" i.e. built in fitting or root finding routines.

If any of this is a problem for grading, please let me know, and I can rewrite in C.  I don't want to make your life harder, I just felt these would be useful for me in Python!
