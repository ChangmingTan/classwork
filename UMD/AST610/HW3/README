HW3, problem2
=============

Run script with simply:

```
$ python scattering.py
```

I've not used the packages that caused an issue the first go around on your
system, so it *should* work fine.

Notes
=====
My plot and values are clearly wrong, and I believe the major flaw is in the 
final determination of net polarization.  I'm pretty confident in my procedures
for determining the scattering angle, the fractional polarization, along with
the overall methodology.  Less confident in, but likely not the overall problem,are the intensity and cross section calculations.

I know, however, that i'm calculating the net polarization correctly after 
the double integral over radius and phi; i needed to find a way to add the the
fractional polarization in such a way as to account for directionality, and
i wasn't able to work my way through that before i ran out of time.

Additionally, my apologies for not handing in a hard copy of the plot.  
Apparently if my printer is out of any one color, it won't let me print
anything.  A "feature" I just discovered.  Apologies again, the PDF will the 
recreated with each run.
